# Task Manager

A simple todo app that uses mongodb for managing tasks data

### Run locally
To run it locally, first create a mongodb databse, whether locally or on [the cloud](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

Then you need to set two environment variables.
```
MONGO_USER=user:password
MONGO_URI=database.mongodb.net
```
or you can set them in a .env file

Then install the required dependencies using `npm i`

Then to run the application run
`npm start`
